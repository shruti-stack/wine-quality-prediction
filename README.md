# wine-quality-prediction
Used RandomForest classifier to predict the quality of wine
This dataset is taken from kaggle.
After  cleaning and preprocessing of data,we used randomforest classifier to predict the quality of wine as good or bad.Our target column was'Quality' where 0 and 1 were our output.
Plotting of graph,helps in visualizing data and getting insights, where we can check relations among feature variable and can drop those features which are of no use in prediction.
Randomforest classifier  is used for  prediction and give accuracy of 78% which is good for model and much practical number.
